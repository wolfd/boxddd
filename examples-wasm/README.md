# WASM Examples

This directory documents browser-oriented WASM work that is not part of the
native example catalog.

## Current Runtime Proof

The runnable WASM proof lives in the core crate because it has no browser UI:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
export WASI_SDK_PATH=/path/to/wasi-sdk-33.0-x86_64-linux
export WASI_SYSROOT="$WASI_SDK_PATH/share/wasi-sysroot"
export CC_wasm32_wasip1="$WASI_SDK_PATH/bin/clang"
cargo build -p boxddd --example wasm_smoke --target wasm32-wasip1
wasmtime target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/examples/wasm_smoke.wasm
```

Expected output:

```text
boxddd wasm smoke passed (single): y 4.000 -> -0.003, hits 2
```

The double-precision build prints the same line with `(double)`, so the WASI
matrix records which ABI actually ran.

## Browser Provider Runtime

Browser-style `wasm32-unknown-unknown` builds use provider mode and a separate
Box3D C provider module, `box3d-sys-v2`, at bridge revision 2:

```bash
BOXDDD_SYS_WASM_MODE=provider cargo check -p boxddd --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The provider smoke verifies the same shared-memory import shape used by browser
apps. It can run headlessly under Node or be packaged into the GitHub Pages demo
alongside the real Bevy + egui Web testbed:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo run -p xtask -- provider-smoke-app

# Requires Emscripten SDK (`emcc`) on PATH or EMSDK set.
# Requires wasm-bindgen-cli for the Bevy Web testbed in build-pages-wasm.
# Uses wasm-opt automatically from PATH or EMSDK/upstream/bin when available.
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.126 --locked
cargo run -p xtask -- provider-smoke
cargo run -p xtask -- build-pages-wasm
```

Expected output:

```text
boxddd provider smoke cycle 1 passed: drop_mm=4002, ray_hit_mm=1500, shape_cast_permyriad=5013, joint_error_mm=0, event_mask=2047, foundation_mask=4095
boxddd provider smoke cycle 2 passed: drop_mm=4002, ray_hit_mm=1500, shape_cast_permyriad=5013, joint_error_mm=0, event_mask=2047, foundation_mask=4095
```

`provider-smoke-app` builds the Rust wasm module and records the exact `b3*`
imports it expects from the manifest-driven `box3d-sys-v2` module. The runner
requires bridge revision 2.
`provider-smoke` additionally builds the Emscripten provider and runs Node with
a shared `WebAssembly.Memory`. Before the Rust application is instantiated, the
runner calls the provider's `boxddd_provider_abi_revision` sentinel and rejects
any bridge revision that differs from `boxddd-sys/box3d-upstream.toml`. This
smoke checks non-callback APIs, proves provider-backed debug draw frame
collection, and asserts that the remaining callback-heavy APIs return
`Error::UnsupportedOnWasm` instead of trapping across wasm module tables.

Each exported smoke entry explicitly initializes the default Foundation. The
exact `foundation_mask=4095` covers idempotent initialization, configuration
conflict, malformed replay input, ordinary/replay exclusion, callback-priority
errors, deferred replay destruction, and ordinary-world recovery. The Node
host grants the provider to one Rust consumer at a time: a second acquire is
rejected without replacing the first, and only the matching release token can
clear the binding.

The intentional debug-destroy callback failure drains the provider error and
poisons that Rust instance's Foundation because infallible teardown has no
narrower surviving owner. The host releases that consumer before constructing
the next Rust module, and cycle 2 proves sequential same-process recovery. This
does not claim simultaneous Rust consumers or recovery inside a poisoned
instance.

Provider mode currently supports the default single-precision ABI only. A build
that combines `BOXDDD_SYS_WASM_MODE=provider` with the `double-precision` feature
fails explicitly; it must not be paired with a single-precision provider.

`build-pages-wasm` publishes two browser surfaces:

- a real `bevy_boxddd/examples/testbed_3d` Bevy + egui app compiled with
  `wasm-bindgen`;
- direct per-scene Pages entries that select the matching Bevy scene by URL and
  share the same Box3D provider runtime.

The Bevy loader reports byte-level download progress for the provider wasm and
the Bevy wasm before instantiating them with a shared `WebAssembly.Memory`. The
loader also validates the provider ABI revision sentinel before loading the Bevy
module. The Bevy page uses the provider-backed debug draw bridge; other
callback-heavy features still keep their explicit `Error::UnsupportedOnWasm`
guardrails until each bridge is designed and tested. This is an ordinary
result-first error path, not a successful empty query.

# WASM Support

`boxddd` now has three WASM tiers:

- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is a browser-oriented compile/import target.
- `wasm32-wasip1` is the first C-backed runtime smoke target.
- provider mode can run as a Node smoke and as published Bevy + egui Web
  examples that share memory between a Rust wasm module and an
  Emscripten-built Box3D C provider.

The supported browser-facing runtime proof is:

- direct Bevy + egui example pages backed by the real
  `bevy_boxddd/examples/testbed_3d` wasm bundle compiled with `wasm-bindgen`.

It does not claim web workers, pthreads, Atomics, or threaded Box3D scheduling
yet.

## Support Matrix

| Surface | Target | Tier | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| `boxddd-sys` | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | compile-only | Uses pregenerated bindings and skips Box3D C compilation. Do not treat the artifact as standalone runnable. |
| `boxddd-sys` | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with `BOXDDD_SYS_WASM_MODE=provider` | provider import bindings | Generates WASM import bindings for the manifest-driven module `box3d-sys-v2`; default precision only. |
| `boxddd-sys` | `wasm32-wasip1` | C-backed runtime | Compiles vendored Box3D C sources with WASI SDK and links them into the Rust WASI module. |
| `boxddd` | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | compile-only/provider examples | Safe APIs type-check. `xtask provider-smoke` runs a Rust wasm app against an Emscripten Box3D provider with shared memory, and Pages publishes the same provider shape as live browser examples. |
| `boxddd` | `wasm32-wasip1` | runtime smoke | `wasm_smoke` creates a world, steps a body, runs a query, and exits successfully. |
| `bevy_boxddd` minimal library | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | compile-only | `--no-default-features` type-checks the library surface. |
| Bevy + egui example pages | browser WASM | provider-backed runtime | `xtask build-pages-wasm` builds `bevy_boxddd/examples/testbed_3d` with `wasm-bindgen` and publishes direct per-scene pages on Pages. |
| Task-system callbacks and replay worker counts | all WASM targets | single-thread only | `TaskSystem::blocking_threads()` is native-only. WASM APIs reject unsupported world and replay worker counts. |

## Compile-Only Checks

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo check -p boxddd-sys --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo check -p boxddd --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo check -p bevy_boxddd --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features
```

Provider import-mode check:

```bash
BOXDDD_SYS_WASM_MODE=provider cargo check -p boxddd --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Provider mode does not compile Box3D C. It rewrites pregenerated bindings so
extern functions import from the module declared in
`boxddd-sys/box3d-upstream.toml`, currently `box3d-sys-v2`. The same manifest
drives the provider asset basename and bridge revision used by `xtask`, the Node
runner, and the Pages loader. The current bridge revision is `2`.

The provider exports `boxddd_provider_abi_revision`. The Node runner and browser
loader compare that sentinel with the manifest-generated bridge revision before
instantiating the Rust application. The module-name revision prevents an old
provider from satisfying `box3d-sys-v2` imports, while the sentinel rejects a
stale or mislabelled provider published under a v2 filename.

Provider mode currently supports only the default single-precision ABI. The
build script explicitly rejects `BOXDDD_SYS_WASM_MODE=provider` combined with
the `double-precision` feature. Double precision remains supported for native
and C-backed WASI source builds; adding it to provider mode requires a separately
declared provider ABI and matching runtime smoke coverage.

## Browser Provider Runtime

The browser runtime has two forms:

- `cargo run -p xtask -- provider-smoke` runs the shared-memory smoke under Node.
- GitHub Pages runs `cargo run -p xtask -- build-pages-wasm` and publishes
  direct Bevy + egui Web example pages.

Prerequisites:

- Rust target: `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Node.js
- `wasm-bindgen-cli` matching the workspace `wasm-bindgen` version
- Emscripten SDK (`emcc` on `PATH`, or `EMSDK` set to the emsdk root) for the
  full provider build
- Binaryen `wasm-opt` is optional; `build-pages-wasm` uses it automatically
  from `PATH` or `EMSDK/upstream/bin` when available.

Rust-side import check:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo run -p xtask -- provider-smoke-app
```

Full provider smoke:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- provider-smoke
```

Pages browser artifacts:

```bash
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.126 --locked
cargo run -p xtask -- build-pages-wasm
```

`build-pages-wasm` defaults the Bevy browser build to the `wasm-release`
profile and then runs `wasm-opt -Oz` for the Bevy and provider wasm assets when
Binaryen is available. Use `BOXDDD_PAGES_WASM_PROFILE=debug`, `release`, or
`wasm-release` to choose another Rust profile, and set `BOXDDD_PAGES_WASM_OPT=0`
when a local or CI environment must skip optional `wasm-opt` post-processing.

`provider-smoke` builds `examples-wasm/provider-smoke` with
`BOXDDD_SYS_WASM_MODE=provider` and `--import-memory`, extracts the exact
`b3*` imports from the Rust wasm, builds
`target/boxddd-provider-smoke/box3d-sys-v2.js` with Emscripten, writes a small
JSON runtime contract, and runs
`examples-wasm/provider-smoke/run-provider-smoke.mjs` under Node. The runner
validates the ABI revision sentinel, instantiates both modules with the same
`WebAssembly.Memory`, and calls `boxddd_provider_smoke`. The smoke proves
ordinary provider calls, the debug draw callback bridge, and the minimal
world-query bridge for AABB overlap and ray-cast visitors. It also checks the
exact Foundation lifecycle mask, rejects a simultaneous Rust consumer, drains
an intentional teardown callback failure, releases the poisoned consumer, and
repeats the full metric set in a fresh sequential Rust instance. Shape overlap, shape
cast, mover collision, dynamic-tree visitors, standalone
mesh/height-field/compound geometry visitors, contact/material callbacks, and
task callbacks still need their own provider bridge before they are claimed for
browser provider mode. The safe wrapper returns `Error::UnsupportedOnWasm` for
those remaining callback-heavy APIs instead of allowing a runtime table trap.

`build-pages-wasm` also builds `bevy_boxddd/examples/testbed_3d` in provider
mode, runs `wasm-bindgen`, extracts the Bevy bundle's actual Box3D imports, and
generates a small JavaScript shim that forwards those imports to the shared
Emscripten provider. The Pages Bevy entries are therefore real Bevy + egui
applications selected by URL, and the loader reports byte-level download
progress for both the provider wasm and the Bevy wasm. Debug draw collection
uses the provider callback bridge, and Query Lab can use the bridged AABB
overlap and ray-cast visitor paths. Other callback-heavy tools remain blocked
with `UnsupportedOnWasm` until their bridges are designed. Query Lab surfaces
those limitations in its egui diagnostics instead of treating unsupported
visitor queries as empty results.

The generated provider shim enforces one active Rust consumer. Acquiring a
second consumer before releasing the first fails without replacing the active
exports, and a stale release token cannot clear a newer binding. Sequential
reinstantiation is supported after complete owner teardown and release;
simultaneous Rust modules sharing one provider are not supported. If an
infallible owner teardown callback fails, the current Rust Foundation remains
poisoned and only a newly instantiated, subsequently acquired Rust module may
resume safe work.

Expected output:

```text
boxddd provider smoke cycle 1 passed: drop_mm=4002, ray_hit_mm=1500, shape_cast_permyriad=5013, joint_error_mm=0, event_mask=2047, foundation_mask=4095
boxddd provider smoke cycle 2 passed: drop_mm=4002, ray_hit_mm=1500, shape_cast_permyriad=5013, joint_error_mm=0, event_mask=2047, foundation_mask=4095
```

Provider mode currently supports non-callback calls such as world/body/shape
creation, stepping, body inspection, closest-ray casts, standalone collision
helpers, distance joint solving, debug draw frame collection, world AABB overlap
visitors, and world ray-cast visitors. Shape overlap, shape cast, mover
collision planes, `DynamicTree` visitor queries/casts, standalone
mesh/height-field/compound geometry visitors, contact/material callbacks, and
Rust-owned task callbacks are blocked with `Error::UnsupportedOnWasm` until
cross-module function-table ownership is designed for each surface.

## C-Backed WASI Runtime Smoke

Prerequisites:

- Rust target: `wasm32-wasip1`
- WASI SDK 33 or newer
- A WASI runner such as `wasmtime`

Linux/macOS shell:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
export WASI_SDK_PATH=/path/to/wasi-sdk-33.0-x86_64-linux
export WASI_SYSROOT="$WASI_SDK_PATH/share/wasi-sysroot"
export CC_wasm32_wasip1="$WASI_SDK_PATH/bin/clang"
cargo build -p boxddd --example wasm_smoke --target wasm32-wasip1
wasmtime target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/examples/wasm_smoke.wasm
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
$env:WASI_SDK_PATH = "C:\path\to\wasi-sdk-33.0-x86_64-windows"
$env:WASI_SYSROOT = "$env:WASI_SDK_PATH\share\wasi-sysroot"
$env:CC_wasm32_wasip1 = "$env:WASI_SDK_PATH\bin\clang.exe"
cargo build -p boxddd --example wasm_smoke --target wasm32-wasip1
wasmtime target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/examples/wasm_smoke.wasm
```

Expected output:

```text
boxddd wasm smoke passed (single): y 4.000 -> -0.003, hits 2
```

The double-precision build reports `(double)`.

If `WASI_SYSROOT` or `WASI_SDK_PATH` is missing, `boxddd-sys` fails early with
an actionable error instead of letting clang fail later on missing libc headers.

## Current CI Gates

CI separates WASM support into visible jobs:

- `WASM compile-only matrix`: checks `boxddd-sys`, `boxddd`, minimal
  `bevy_boxddd`, and provider import-mode type checking for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- `WASM runtime smoke (WASI)`: installs WASI SDK, builds `wasm_smoke` for
  `wasm32-wasip1`, and runs it under `wasmtime`.
- `WASM provider smoke`: installs Emscripten SDK, builds the provider-mode Rust
  smoke and default-precision Box3D C provider, validates the ABI revision
  sentinel, and runs the shared-memory Node smoke.
- `Pages`: installs Emscripten SDK and `wasm-bindgen-cli`, then builds direct
  Bevy + egui Web example pages for GitHub Pages.

## Remaining Browser Work

The browser route follows the same shape as `dear-imgui-rs`: a Rust app WASM
module imports C symbols from a provider module, and both modules share the same
`WebAssembly.Memory`. The current browser surfaces prove the memory/import part
of this runtime contract through direct Bevy + egui Web example pages.

Callback-heavy APIs need an explicit provider bridge instead of passing Rust
closure pointers directly into another wasm module. Provider ABI v2 bridges
debug draw collection plus world AABB-overlap and ray-cast visitors. The
remaining boundaries are documented in [`wasm-callbacks.md`](wasm-callbacks.md):
keep result-first `Error::UnsupportedOnWasm` for unimplemented surfaces, and
leave task-system worker callbacks until the blocking `finishTask` and browser
worker policy are fully specified.

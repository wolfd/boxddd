# Box3D Official Sample Parity Matrix

This matrix maps the official samples registered by Box3D commit `30c67b5e6d0a3a66f0f506c69ce9e9e0587e3b7c` to `boxddd` and `bevy_boxddd` teaching material.
It is a case-level parity map, not a promise to port every C++ sample host feature line-for-line.

The source of truth is the generated inventory in `docs/upstream-parity/box3d-sample-inventory.json`.
The inventory is derived from the pinned upstream commit, so parity checking does not depend on retaining the upstream sample host in the vendored runtime tree.
Run the parity check whenever the upstream manifest, generated inventory, or matrix changes:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- sample-parity --check
```

## Parity Modes

- **FaithfulPort**: the Rust example or Bevy scene closely follows the official sample's user-visible behavior.
- **TeachingAdaptation**: the Rust or Bevy artifact teaches the same Box3D concept with idiomatic `boxddd` structure.
- **TestOnly**: the case is better proven through a focused test, core example, or deterministic smoke than a visual scene.
- **Deferred**: the case is intentionally not part of the current public teaching surface; the note records the trigger for future work.
- **UpstreamReference**: the case is tied to the official sample host or renderer and remains reference material.

## Category Summary

| Category | Cases | Current Rust strategy |
|---|---:|---|
| Benchmark | 19 | Deferred until a Rust benchmark harness has explicit measurement goals. |
| Bodies | 12 | Common controls are covered; measured gyroscopic precession remains deferred. |
| Character | 4 | Covered through mover examples and the Bevy character mover scene. |
| Collision | 12 | Covered through query/collision examples, tests, and picking scenes. |
| Compound | 6 | Covered through compound, mesh, height-field, and advanced collider examples. |
| Continuous | 9 | Covered for the common bullet/TOI path; mesh stress cases stay test/deferred. |
| Determinism | 4 | Covered at contract level through recording/replay plus query and collision tests; exact upstream scenario hashes are not claimed. |
| Events | 7 | Covered through event examples, Bevy messages, and focused tests. |
| Geometry | 5 | Covered through collision geometry tests and collider examples. |
| Issues | 10 | Deferred until a corresponding wrapper regression is reproduced. |
| Joints | 16 | Covered through joint gallery/testbed scenes and joint runtime tests. |
| Manifold | 9 | Covered through headless manifold collision tests. |
| Mesh | 9 | Covered through mesh/height-field examples; renderer viewer and creation benchmark are deferred/reference. |
| Ragdoll | 5 | Covered as ragdoll-chain teaching adaptation except pose editing and mesh rig details. |
| Replay | 1 | Covered through recording/replay example and tests, not the upstream ImGui viewer. |
| Robustness | 4 | Deferred until a wrapper regression or robustness target appears. |
| Shapes | 12 | Covered through materials, wind, collision, and collider scenes; conveyor authoring remains deferred. |
| Stacking | 14 | Common stacks are covered through falling-stack, domino, and arch scenes; edge-crossing stress remains deferred. |
| Tree | 1 | Covered through dynamic tree example and tests. |
| World | 4 | Deferred until far-origin precision behavior becomes user-facing. |

## Deferred Route Summary

The matrix contains 43 Deferred rows. They are intentional routing decisions, not untriaged backlog.
Use this table when deciding whether a future change should remain deferred, become a benchmark, become a regression test, or become a visual scene.

| Bucket | Deferred rows | Route |
|---|---:|---|
| Benchmark stress scenes | 19 | Convert only when `boxddd/benches` has a measured throughput or allocation goal for the specific scenario. Do not turn these into visual examples unless they teach a user-facing workflow. |
| Upstream issue repros | 10 | Convert to a focused regression test only after the upstream behavior reproduces through safe `boxddd` wrappers. Until then they remain upstream references. |
| Robustness scenes | 4 | Convert to release-risk tests when scale, mass-ratio, recovery, or debug-color behavior exposes a Rust API contract or bug. |
| Conveyor scenes | 2 | Convert to a Bevy material/conveyor showcase after tangent velocity or equivalent conveyor authoring is available safely in `bevy_boxddd`. `material-lab` covers material coefficients today, not conveyor motion. |
| Far-world scenes | 4 | Convert after `boxddd` documents a far-origin precision contract and has a visual or headless assertion worth teaching. |
| Ragdoll pose | 1 | Convert only when interactive pose editing or rig import becomes part of the Bevy teaching surface; `ragdoll-chain` remains the current lightweight joint-chain adaptation. |
| Mesh creation benchmark | 1 | Convert with the benchmark bucket when mesh construction throughput has explicit measurement goals. |
| Body/collision stress references | 2 | Convert gyroscopic precession or edge crossing only when a focused teaching artifact or stable regression assertion exists. |
